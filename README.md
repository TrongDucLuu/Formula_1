A real-time Formula 1 telemetry system and historical data analysis system that captures, processes, and visualizes car data during race sessions, enabling both live replay and historical analysis.

The project involves a two fold analysis approach

- Realtime Race replay - To replay how the Race would pan out, and dive deep into what and how things changed that led to an outcome. (Would work during the race as well :) )
- Historical analysis - To answer important questions which involves post race analysis, about how weather impacts the outcome, tyre choices , race strategies and pit strategies

The system serves two primary analytical purposes:

### Real-Time Race Replay

Using live telemetry data, the system reconstructs race sessions in real-time, allowing viewers to experience the race as it unfolds. This feature provides deep insights into crucial moments by visualizing:

- Driver performance through speed, throttle, and brake data
- Strategic DRS (Drag Reduction System) usage
- Gear selection patterns across different track sections
- Dynamic position changes and overtaking maneuvers

### Historical Analysis & Strategic Insights

Beyond real-time replay, the system enables comprehensive post-race analysis to understand the intricate factors that influence race outcomes:

- Weather impact on tire degradation and pit stop timing
- Effectiveness of different pit strategies across varying track conditions
- Analysis of tire compound choices and their influence on race pace

By combining real-time telemetry with historical data, this platform serves as both an engaging visualization tool and a powerful analytical resource for understanding the technical and strategic elements that define Formula 1 racing.

# Motivation

Formula 1 racing represents the pinnacle of motorsport technology, where split-second decisions and minute performance differences determine victory. This project presents a comprehensive Formula 1 telemetry analysis system that brings together real-time data streaming and historical insights to unlock the complexities of race strategy and performance.

This has been a passion project of mine since long and i hope to keep improving and deploying it down the line for anyone to use and make sense of what factors led to the Race outcome

# Project Scope

- The project comprises 3 major sections  :
    - Real-time Streaming Pipeline using Confluent Kafka, SingleStore , AWS ec2 deployment
    - Historical Trend Analysis using DBT , Snowflake , Airflow (WAP maintaining idempodency)
    - Grafana (Interactive visualizations and deep dive)

## Dataset Choices

- For the most part i came across multiple data sources that help
    
    
    | Data_source | Data_source_type | Cost | Longevity | Support and community | Advantages |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | [Fast-F1](https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file) | Python / pandas-based | Free | Din‚Äôt offer a robust API | 2.5k stars on github | 
    ‚Ä¢ Implements caching for all API requests to speed up your scripts |
    | [Ergast](http://ergast.com/mrd/) | REST-API | Free | will be [Depricated](http://ergast.com/mrd/limit-parameter-restriction/) (End of 2024) |  | Been around for a while, quite relaible with the data |
    | [OpenF1](https://openf1.org/?python#pit) | open-source API | Free | Quite active (as of today) | 368 stars |  |
    | [SportMonks](https://my.sportmonks.com/subscriptions/create/sport/2/plans) | API | Paid (65 euros/month) | Reliable | -  | Accurate well maintained and can be banked on  |
    
    My choice was OpenF1 for the following reasons:
    
    - The API is directly sourced from [F1 LiveTiming](https://www.formula1.com/en/timing/) , So in future after i subscribe the data json would look similar and i can directly source from the official site
    - Offers multiple data in depth with different API endpoints. essentially 1 API with multiple API endpoints that give different data (High frequency data and low frequency generic info)
    - Had structure and relationships between endpoints, that would let me correlate the effect of one over the other

## High level Architecture Diagram

## Technology choices:

### Real-time Streaming Pipeline

The real-time component leverages 

Confluent Kafka hosted on AWS EC2, paired with SingleStore as our operational database. This architecture was chosen for several compelling reasons:

- **Confluent Kafka** serves as our message broker because it excels at handling high-throughput, real-time data streams with minimal latency.
- Formula 1 telemetry generates thousands of data points per second across multiple cars especially the telemetry metrics like speed , throttle metrics, and Kafka's publish-subscribe model perfectly suits this use case. The platform's robust partitioning and fault tolerance ensure we never miss critical race data. Four topics in my producer that is consumed by singlestore pipelines
    
  ![Streaming](./images/realtime_streaming_pipeline_image_1.jpeg)
    
    ## **SingleStore**
    
    **SingleStore** was selected as our operational database due to its unique ability to handle both real-time data ingestion and analytical queries simultaneously. Its columnar storage format and vector processing capabilities make it ideal for processing time-series telemetry data while maintaining sub-second query response times for our dashboards. Serving as both OLTP and OLAP database in one, which can perform high fidelity data ingests, analysis over millions of rows with ms latency  
    
    ![Singlesore](./images/Singlestore_image_1.png)
    
- **AWS EC2** provides the scalable infrastructure needed to handle variable workloads during race weekends versus off-peak periods. The cloud deployment ensures high availability and enables easy scaling during peak racing events.

### Historical Trend Analysis

For deeper historical analysis, we implemented a robust data warehouse solution using:

- DBT (Data Build Tool) manages our data transformations, enabling us to create clean, tested, and documented data models. Its version control and modularity allow us to maintain complex racing analytics while ensuring data quality through built-in testing.
    
    
- Snowflake serves as our data warehouse, chosen for its separation of storage and compute resources. This architecture is particularly valuable for F1 analysis, where we might need to process years of historical race data while simultaneously handling real-time queries.
- Apache Airflow orchestrates our ETL workflows using the Write Audit Publish (WAP) pattern to maintain idempotency. This ensures our historical analysis remains accurate and reproducible, even when processing data from multiple racing seasons.

### Interactive Visualization

Grafana ties our entire solution together through interactive dashboards that serve both real-time and historical analysis needs. We chose Grafana for its:

- Ability to handle real-time data streams with  refresh rates as low as 1s
- Support for complex time-series visualizations essential for race telemetry
- Flexible query builders that work seamlessly with both SingleStore and Snowflake

```

The processes have the following stages of data architecture:

## Data Ingestion

 ![Ingestion](./images/Airflow_image.jpeg)

I made sure during my ingestion these 5 properties are always maintained

### Idempodency ( Merge keys )

- No two non-unique recods are added to the table also ensuring upserts only
- Created a dynamic since the structure of the statement remains same
    
    ![Idempodency_1](./images/Idempodency_image_1.jpeg)    
    ![Idempodency_1](./images/Idempodency_image_2.jpeg)    
    

## API call retires and Fallbacks

- So API‚Äôs are unreliable sometimes, hence having retry feature to make sure, no data is left behind during ingest
    
     ![API_retires](./images/Api_calls_retires.jpeg) 
    
- Handling high frequency data
    - For telemetry high frequency data, i broke my api calls into 5 min chunks
    - Let‚Äôs say the API still produces too much data to handle, then it fallback into 1/2 the window size and then continues to maintain 5 min windows for the next call
        
     ![API_retires](./images/handling_high_frequency_data.jpeg) 
        

## Always ingest into a temp staging table

- Made sure the production table is not impacted by ingestion issues (always ingesting to a staging table and dropping it immediately after succesful merge)
    
     ![ingest](./images/Always_ingest_into_temp.jpeg)
    

## Compute resources ( save costs)

- There is no Race every single day so i made sure i don‚Äôt exhaust the compute resources on a non race day
    
    ![compute](./images/compute_recources.jpeg)
  
    

## Data Transformation

These are all my data transformations

- Anything prefixed with stg are my staging models.
- Prefixed with ‚Äúf1_‚Äù are my data marts and used in final dashboards
- Prefixed with ‚Äúint_‚Äù are my intermediate models used a lot in multiple marts as well
    
    ![data_transformations](./images/data_transformations.jpeg)
  
    

My Transformations on a high level include:

### Staging models ( Pulled from tested source  table ):

`dbt_project/models/staging`

- Things like (Changing datatype and names of my columns)
    - Changing datatype and names of my columns
        - `driver_number::VARCHAR(50) as driver_number,`
        - `TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(date) as timestamp,`
        - `NULLIF(gap_to_leader, 'None') as gap_to_leader`
        - `DATEADD(second, lap_duration, DATE_TRUNC('second', date_start)) AS date_end,`
    - Adding columns for time ranges
        - `DATE_TRUNC('second', date_start) AS date_start,`
    
    ### Intermediate models ( Pulled from tested staging  models and other int_models alone ): few example below
    
    `dbt_project/models/intermediate`
    
    - Weather (Computing averages and Categorizing my dashboards)
        
       ![Intermediate_1](./images/intermediate_models_1.jpeg)
      
        
    - Computing lap wise start and end positions
        
        ![Intermediate_2](./images/intrmediate_models_2.jpeg)
        
        ## Marts (`dbt_project/models/marts`)
        
        Used directly in dashboards
        
        - There were only position changes , so i had to fill positions for the laps where there was no position change , to understand how the position evolved
            
            ![marts_1](./images/marts_1.jpeg)
          
            
        - A mart for dashboard filters as well
            ![marts_2](./images/marts_2.jpeg)
